Coding challenge

My solution consists of:
1. a server side program developed in C# for reading the ModBus raw data, and stores the data in an SQLite database (GambitChallenge.zip)
and
2. a responsive ASP.NET Webpage that reads the data from the database and displays it to the user (WebSite3.zip)

The webpage can be accessed through http://213.136.72.42:8080/
